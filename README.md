# VitalCare 🩺⌚

**VitalCare** is a hackathon project that demonstrates the concept of an **ecosystem for smart wearable devices**.  
The idea is simple but powerful: multiple wearables (such as smart watches, fitness trackers, and health sensors) can **communicate with each other** to create a **connected ecosystem**.  
By sharing data between devices, the system provides a **more personalized and holistic healthcare experience** for both patients and doctors.

---

## 🚀 The Idea
Current wearables work in isolation. VitalCare aims to connect them into a **smart ecosystem** where:
- Devices **share health data** in real-time.  
- Doctors and patients get **better insights** from combined analytics.  
- Personalized recommendations and alerts are generated based on **integrated device data**.  
- Ecosystem reduces dependency on a single device and improves **accuracy of monitoring**.

---

## 🖥️ Hackathon Demo
This repository is a **web-based prototype** built using **HTML, CSS, and basic JS** to showcase the flow of the idea.  
It includes different mockup pages to represent the ecosystem:

- **Landing Page (`index.html`)** → Introduction to VitalCare  
- **Login Page (`login.html`)** → Simple mock login for patients/doctors  
- **Doctor Dashboard (`doctor-dashboard.html`)** → Overview of patient vitals and reports  
- **Patient Dashboard (`patient-dashboard.html`)** → Personalized health data view  
- **Store (`Store.html`)** → Concept of an ecosystem store for smart wearables & services  

*(Note: These are static mockups, no backend or database is connected. Built purely for hackathon demo.)*

## ✨ Features in the Demo
- Patient & Doctor dashboard mockups  
- Conceptual store for wearables  
- Visualization of connected health monitoring  
- Simple navigation flow

## 👩‍💻 Team & Hackathon

This project was built as part of a **Hackathon** to demonstrate the **ecosystem concept for smart wearables**.
It’s not a full product yet, but a **proof-of-concept demo** for further development.
The hackathon took palce at NIT AP.
